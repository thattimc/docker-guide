A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## Docker Container Image

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images become containers when they run on Docker Engine.

## Docker Container Registry

Docker container registry is an image storage place that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Just like Github for storing code repositories.
